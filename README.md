## Code Examples

A Voice Application is a server that takes control of the flow in a call. A Voice Application can use any combination of the following verbs:

- `Answer` - Accepts an incoming call
- `Hangup` - Closes the call
- `Play` - Takes an URL or file and streams the sound back to the calling party
- `Say` - Takes a text, synthesizes the text into audio, and streams back the result
- `Gather` - Waits for DTMF or speech events and returns back the result
- `SGather` - Returns a stream for future DTMF and speech results
- `Dial` - Passes the call to an Agent or a Number at the PSTN
- `Record` - It records the voice of the calling party and saves the audio on the Storage sub-system
- `Mute` - It tells the channel to stop sending media, effectively muting the channel
- `Unmute` - It tells the channel to allow media flow

Voice Application Example:

```typescript
const { VoiceServer } = require("@fonoster/voice");

const serverConfig = {
  pathToFiles: `${process.cwd()}/sounds`,
};

new VoiceServer(serverConfig).listen(
  async (req, res) => {
    console.log(req);
    await res.answer();
    await res.play(`sound:${req.selfEndpoint}/sounds/hello-world.sln16`);
    await res.hangup();
  }
);

// your app will live at http://127.0.0.1:3000 
// and you can easily publish it to the Internet with:
// ngrok http 3000
```

Everything in FN is an API first, and initiating a call is no exception. You can use the SDK to start a call with a few lines of code.

Example of originating a call with the SDK:

```typescript
const Fonoster = require("@fonoster/sdk");
const callManager = new Fonoster.CallManager();

callManager.call({
 from: "9842753574",
 to: "17853178070",
 webhook: "https://5a2d2ea5d84d.ngrok.io/voiceapp"
})
 .then(console.log)
 .catch(console.error);
```
